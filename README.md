![MISRAC2012 Compliant](https://eenews.cdnartwhere.eu/sites/default/files/styles/inner_article/public/import/2014-07-22-edne-gp-misra-logo-snip.jpg?itok=bQVhv7S_)

Checked with C-STAT for MISRAC2012 Compliance.

QuarkTS is an operating system that provides a modern environment to build stable and predictable event-driven multitasking embedded software. The OS is built on top of a cooperative quasi-static scheduler and its simplified kernel implements a specialized round-robin scheme using a linked-chain approach and an event-queue to provide true FIFO priority-scheduling.

## Features:
- Prioritized cooperative scheduling.
- Time control (Timed tasks and software timers)
- Inter-Task comunnication primitives, queues, notifications and event-flags.
- State-Machines ( hierarchical support )
- Co-routines.
- AT Command Line Interface (CLI)

All the included features make this OS suitable for resource-constrained microcontrollers, where a full-preemptive RTOS is an overkill and their inclusion adds unnecessary complexity to the firmware development. Their modularity and reliability make this OS a great choice to develop efficiently a wide range of applications in low-cost devices, including automotive controls, monitoring and Internet of Things.
